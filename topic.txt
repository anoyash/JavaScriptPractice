- hoisting
    a. Variable and functions are hoisted in javascript . It can be used before initialization
- types in js
    ( primitives vs Reference )
        primitives : number , strings , undefined , boolean , null 
        Any value , which when copied from one identifier to another, It copies the original value
        So, changes made in destination Variable does not impact the source Variable.

        reference = [] , {} , ()
        Any value , which when copied from one identifier to another, rather than copy the actual value.
        It will copy the reference.
        So, changes made in destination Variable , is directly affecting the original Variable.
